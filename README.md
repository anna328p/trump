Welcome to DonaldTracker, don't steal our code without permission. Well, if you get our permission, it's no longer stealing :)

##Instructions

We should start off by saying that we assume you are on a Mac.
First, go to your terminal. Check if you have git installed. If you are not sure type:

```git --version```

If you don't get a version number, you don't have git installed. To install git, just type

`git`

You should be prompted to download some tools. Make sure you do so.

From there, you need to decide where you want this project to go. I suggest the Documents folder. Navigate in the terminal to the folder where you want to put all your files in. Do not make a new folder! So instead of being in `Documents/Trump` where Trump is a new folder you made, just be in `Documents`.

Once, you are there, in your terminal type

`git clone https://github.io/joshfeinsilber/trump`

This will make a folder on your computer with all the files in this repo. 

Now, make sure you have a GitHub account, I mean come on. You really should have one. Once you do, remember the email you signed up with. Navigate to your "trump" folder and enter in the terminal

`git config user.email "your_email@example.com"`

After this, go download MAMP. https://www.mamp.info/en/
Go to preferences, Web Server and set your Document Root folder to the Trump folder. Start the server and navigate to localhost:8888

If you see the homepage, you are good to go!
